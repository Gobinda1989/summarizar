Text Extractor:

step 1:
create dataset: Dataset needs to be created reading the folder and we get list of the text

step 2:
clean data: clean the text and using sentence tokenizer convert it list of sentences

step3:
Sentence Embedding: apply word embedding for word tokens the sentences. Here word2Vec is used.

step 4:
similiarity matrix generation: Initialize similarity_matrix of dimension N x N where N is the total number of sentences in the text. Using 1-spatial.distance.cosine(), calculate the similarity between every two pairs of sentences.
PageRank is applied

step 5:
Top 4 sentences are popped out and output is stored in csv
